# Android Robot Controller
This is an Android application to control a robot using ROS

## Setting the system to compile the application
In order to have the environment correctly set to develop in android, follow the this [guide](http://wiki.ros.org/android/Tutorials/kinetic/Installation%20-%20ROS%20Development%20Environment).
### Install ros-java-build-tools
First of all is necessary to install the java build tools for ROS. If you have ROS kinetic, you can install this package from deb. Since I have ROS melodic, I have to build ros-java from source. For the instructions, see this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/kinetic/Source%20Installation).
